# Week 7: AI Activity Instructions

In this folder, the student will find the neccessary files for this week activities.

To start the activity do the following steps

1) Compile the project
2) Run sign_rec get_samples.py
3) Run sign_rec detect_sign.py

## Torubleshoot 

We have detected some cases where the version installed by pip is not the latest and that crashes the load model command.

The version that we used in the course is `2.6.2` in python `3.6.9`




## Notes
 * All acitvities must be performed in the real robot and the gazebo simulation.

  - Remember to make the nodes executable using the the following command inside the catkin_ws/src/basic_comms/src and catkin_ws/src/basic_comms/src
 folders 
```
 chmod +x signal_generator.py
 chmod +x process.py
```

## Rules
  * This is challenge not a class. The students are encouraged to research, improve tune explain their algorithms by themselves.
  * MCR2(Manchester Robotics) Reserves the right to answer a question if it is determined that the questions contains partially or totally an answer.
  * The students are welcomed to ask only about the theoretical aspect of the classed.
  * No remote control or any other form of human interaction with the simulator or ROS is allowed (except at the start when launching the files).
  * It is forbidden to use any other internet libraires with the exception of standard libraires or NumPy.
  * If in doubt about libraires please ask any teaching assistant.
  * Improvements to the algorithms are encouraged and may be used as long as the students provide the reasons and a detailed explanation on the improvements.
  * All the students must be respectful towards each other and abide by the previously defined rules.
  * Manchester robotics reserves the right to provide any form of grading. Grading and grading methodology are done by the professor in charge of the unit.
