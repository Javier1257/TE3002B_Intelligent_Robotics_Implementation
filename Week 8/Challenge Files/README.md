# Chalenge Files

* In this folder, the student will find the necessary files for the Final Challenge.


## Description
  * This challenge is intended for the student to review the concepts introduced in this course.
  * This challenge aims to show the behaviour of Control, Localisation, Vision and Neural Networks in mobile robotics.

  ### Camera Lens
  * Folder containing information on how to install the wide-angle camera lens to the robot.
  ### Gazebo Simulator
  * Folder containing the gazebo simulator, files, and instructions to be used for this challenge.
  ### Traffic Lights
  * Folder containing the information on how to install and use the Traffic Lights with the Puzzletrack.
  ### Traffic Signs
  * Folder containing the information on how to install and use the Traffic Signs with the Puzzletrack.
      


## Notes
 * All activities must be performed in the real robot.
 * A gazebo simulator is provided for testing purposes.

    - Remember to make the nodes executable using the following command inside the catkin_ws/src/basic_comms/src and catkin_ws/src/basic_comms/src
 folders 
```
 chmod +x $SCRIPT.py
```

## Rules
### General
* This is a challenge, not a class. The students are encouraged to research, improve tune explain their algorithms by themselves.
* All teams must abide by the rules set at each campus when using the track.
* All the students must respect each other and abide by the following rules.
* Manchester Robotics Ltd. reserves the right to provide any form of grading. Grading and grading methodology are done by the professor in charge of the unit.
* This task will be graded according to the rules established by the professors of each campus.
### Feedback
* MCR2(Manchester Robotics) Reserves the right to answer a question if it is determined that the query contains a partial or an answer.
* The students are welcome to ask only about the theoretical aspect of the class.
* The professors at each campus are encouraged to serve only as guides for the students, not revealing in any form a partial or total answer to the question.
### Race
* No remote control or other form of human interaction with the robot is allowed; except at the start/end of the track (put the robot on the track at the start and remove it afterwards).
* The robot must always follow the black middle line (except at the intersection).
* The robot must remain bound inside the lane (between right and left black lines). 
* The robot must obey all the Traffic signs and Traffic Lights.
* No other trajectory or changes in the course are allowed.
### Hardware/Software
* The track can be solved using any knowledge acquired during the course. 
* The students must only use the hardware given by Manchester Robotics.
* Using other internet libraries except for standard libraries such as NumPy is forbidden.
* If in doubt about libraries, please ask any teaching assistant.
* Improvements to the algorithms are encouraged and may be used if the students provide the reasons and a detailed explanation of the improvements.
